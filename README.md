Hello everyone. 

Welcome to my repository which explain the Black Scholes Model and give a ready to use easy implementation of the same.

The Detailed handwritten explanation can be found in my "notes.pdf". It explains all the features used in this repo. All you need to know is some basic knowledge of how a market might look, rest everything is explained in the notes, one does not need knowledge of the terminologies to understand it since all the terminologies are explained.

This is version 1 of the implementation. In future Implementations I will include automation where the inputs will be collected directly using yfinance and the user only has to specify the stock name and duration.

Plz note: This repo does not have the explanation of how and why the Black-Scholes Equation works. This is merely an implementation of it. In future updates, the logical intuition behind the Black-Scholes equation may be added.
